# DACS v0.1 — conformance vectors

An independent, third-party set of executable conformance vectors for DACS v0.1, run against the verifier in this repo. Point your own DACS implementation at the same inputs and diff the outputs.

> Proposed / non-normative. MIT. The steward owns all normative and namespace calls — this is a contributor artifact, not part of the standard.

Surface labels travel with each vector:

- **GOLDEN (219)** — byte-stable and accepted by this reference verifier: 7 canonicalize, 5 decimal, 5 signing, 16 DACS-1, 2 addressing, 4 §10.4 bundle, 17 dispute/disclosure, 61 settlement, 47 verify, 32 vet, 11 negotiate, and 12 governance checks.
- **CANDIDATE (0)** — no current candidate vectors.

## Why

The spec's §14 conformance chapter defines conformant behaviour but ships no second independent verifier and no published vectors. This is one: byte-stable primitive, identity, addressing, settlement, verify, vet, negotiate, governance, bundle, and proposed DACS-X dispute/disclosure vectors accepted by this reference verifier.

## Run

```sh
bun conformance/run.ts          # run all 219 vectors → exit non-zero on any failure
bun conformance/run.ts --emit   # regenerate MANIFEST.json + vectors/golden.json
bun run conformance:bundle-binding # cross-run DACS-Standard PR #248 BundleBinding candidates
```

Deterministic by construction: every key and signature is derived from a fixed public seed (`examples/issuer-kit.ts`) and every timestamp is pinned, so each run is byte-stable. No private key material is stored — seeds are public test inputs. DACS-X inputs are constructed in `run.ts` itself and pin bundle fixtures by `(jobId,bundleHash)`.

### BundleBinding candidate cross-run

`bundle-binding-pr248-cross-run.ts` independently executes the nine `bundle-binding-v0.1` candidate decisions from DACS-Standard PR #248. The report pins the exact upstream commit, source path, vendored path, and vector SHA-256. Its candidate-only resolver takes the role-to-party map as authenticated caller input; it does not derive authorization from the fetched candidate it is deciding whether to trust. The harness covers the frozen inline Ed25519 vector envelope only; it is not exported as a production DACS-5 resolver and makes no implementation claim for extended-pointer dereferencing or other BundleSignature suites.

This is cross-implementation evidence over a candidate surface, not certification or a new normative source. DACS-Standard remains authoritative for the inputs and expected decisions.

## Coverage

- `canonicalize`: 7 golden vectors, §7.1 JCS canonicalization and §7.2 signed scope.
- `decimal`: 5 golden vectors, §14.4 CD-1 canonical decimals and §9.3 positivity.
- `signing`: 5 golden vectors, §7.7 domain-separated Ed25519 (SIG-2 / SIG-4).
- `dacs1`: 16 golden vectors, §6.3 identity bundles, SIWD Resource binding, freshness, identityTier derivation, requirement matching, listing validation, and forged/unresolved `verifiedBy` fail-closed tiering.

(The former HTLC-9 `correction`-amendment vector was retired — Round-4 R4-A removed the correction amendment and resolves an HTLC-9 asymmetric settlement through the ST-8 `settle-asymmetric` state at the settlement layer; see the §14.5 verify-st-asymmetric-* vectors.)

- `settlement`: 58 golden vectors, §14.4 SettlementEvidence verification and §9.5.8 SB-1/SB-2 consumer-scoped settlement-tx-id uniqueness — PC-1..7 (anchor, attestationRef→evidence hash, outcome classification, currency-resolution, settlementFinality, anchor-pending cross-chain return), per-rail success (incl. `pay-x402` gasless-USDC-on-Base and coherent provider-receipt fallback, §9.5.7), event/instruction-level settlement-tx-id canonicalisation, rail id/chain/cluster binding, Solana signature-alias rejection, mixed coordinate-family rejection, malformed or incomplete event refs as verifier `fail` / SB-2 `error`, duplicate settlement-tx-id rejection across obligations, same-obligation idempotence, consumer-view scoping, HTLC finality parameters, RD-5 railType↔asset/network coherence, §9.5.1/PIPE-5 amount==agreement.terms.price, CD-1/§9.3 amount canonicalisation, and the `dacs-4-evidence` signature.
- `verify`: 47 golden vectors, §14.5 DACS-5 Verify — two-sided lookup `stor-{sha256(jobId+"-bundle-"+role)}` (§10.4.2) with jobId binding, §10.4.3(a-d) consumption (one-sided→aborted-by-self per §10.11, unified, divergent — "divergent" is a **consumer verdict, NOT an `outcome` enum value**), the ST-1..8 transition table + state→outcome mapping (§10.3.1, incl. the non-terminal `settle-asymmetric` HTLC-9 open state, ST-8), and reputation derivation (§10.5.1 — two-sided per-jobId reconciliation via `anchoredByRole` with `perspective_flip` of a counterparty-anchored copy per §10.11; `party_fault_denom` excludes `failed-substrate`; null≠zero; rating aggregation with `(rater,jobId,targetRole)` de-duplication; deterministic receipt `windowingBasis` + sorted `bundleRefs`; `observedTransactionalVolume` grouped by currency).
- `vet`: 24 golden vectors, DACS-2 method contract, retry semantics, MA-1..3 resolution, freshness, oneOf/cross-accumulator precedence, and counterparty-malformed fault attribution.
- `negotiate`: 11 golden vectors, §8.5.2 listing-conformance checks including CD-1 price validation and negotiable band math.
- `governance`: 12 golden vectors, §14.7 GOV-1..3 steward disclosure and pin-time anchoring-phase checks.

## §8.7 arbitrator-disclosure (step 3)

The disclosure vectors exercise DACS-X step 3 under steward sign-off **DP-1**: the full §8.7 channel transcript is disclosed to the **named arbitrator only**, producing **no presentable artifact**. A `dacs-x-disclosure-grant` (SIG-4) authorizes one transcript → one credentialed arbitrator → one dispute, either by **signed party agreement** (every channel member co-signs) or by **arbitrator order**. The verifier enforces: recipient is the credentialed arbitrator (anti-swap, DP-5 bilateral selection), the disclosed transcript matches the grant's pinned hash (anti-substitution), the grant binds to the open dispute, the transcript's own member signatures verify, and the result is a bare check — nothing re-anchorable. It is structurally distinct from §11.2.7 claim-disclosure (different object, audience, and output). No new cryptography — §7.7 signing + §7.2 hashing + DACS-1 claim references only (DP-4).

## Files

- `fixtures/settlement-evidence-payment-success.json` — a byte-stable pay-evm-erc20 success SettlementEvidence (§9.7) with its PaymentPhaseInput + PhaseHandlerResult, signed by a deterministic orchestrator key.
- `fixtures/settlement-evidence-delivery-success.json` — a byte-stable deliver-storage-program success SettlementEvidence (deliverable content hash + anchor, no settlementFinality).
- `fixtures/session-bundle-one-sided.json` — a one-signature `aborted-by-other` bundle for the §10.4.3(b)/§10.11 one-sided case.

- `run.ts` — the runner; also the executable spec of how each input is constructed.

## Implementation observations (non-normative)

Vectors that double as executable evidence of implementation friction. Stated as observations for the group to confirm or correct, not as normative claims:

- **DACS-VERIFY-0001** — a `cci-lei:` claim does **not** satisfy a bare `lei` requirement (§6.3.1 registers `cci-lei`; §6.3.3/§7.4.2 use bare `lei`; `find_claim` does exact-scheme equality). Adjacent to issue **#42**'s broader `ClaimReference` canonical-equality discussion.
- **DACS-VERIFY-0002** — separators used normatively in the spec body (e.g. `dacs-session-binding:v1:`, `dacs-sealed-bid:v1:`) are absent from the §7.7 closed registry and are not `x-`-prefixed (SIG-4).
- **DACS-VERIFY-0003** — the §6.3.4 native-address rule yields `stor-<64hex>`, whereas Demos addresses `stor-<40hex>` keyed differently. A listing anchored per the spec rule would not resolve on the substrate. *Verify on substrate before relying.*
- **DACS-VERIFY-0004** — `conformance/fixtures/attestation-bundle-0004.json` is a full completed §10.4 `AttestationBundle`, signed by buyer + seller with deterministic issuer-kit keys. `conformance/fixtures/attestation-bundle-0004-seller.json` is a same-`jobId` divergent seller-side bundle with outcome `failed-counterparty`; it also verifies and has a distinct bundle hash. Divergent-bundle dispute/disclosure vectors pin both refs. The bundle verifier accepts valid bundles, rejects a completed bundle missing a required signer, and surfaces malformed resolved keys as `error`.

The published golden vectors (`dacs1-cci-lei-defect`, `dacs1-native-address`, etc.) assert the observed behaviour, so the evidence is runnable.
